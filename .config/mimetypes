# This file determines rules for opening different types of files using "lbt open".
# Rules are ordered by priority, the ones at the top have the highest priority.

# First column is a glob pattern for matching MIME types.
# Second column is the action: "save" means that the file must be downloaded before opening, "stream" means that the program can open the file as an HTTP stream.
# Anything after the second column is ignored.
